# Breadth First Search
In a binary tree, we can use bfs to search row-by-row. Use level order and stop when we find the value.

# Depth First Search
In a binary tree, we can use any depth-first traversals (in-order, pre-order,post-order) and stop when we find the value. Pre order is more useful since we can stop earlier than in-order or post-order.
